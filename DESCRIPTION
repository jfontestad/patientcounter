Description: Fast, flexible census of patient occupancy in multiple locations in 
    hospital setting. Obtain the net count of patients by interval, accounting 
    for those admitted prior to specific intervals, those who move during 
    intervals, and those not yet discharged, without requiring a database 
    or knowledge of 'SQL'.
